Rake / Active Record Reflections

Rake includes commands to make it easier to interact with our environment (models
and database)

Migration files are used to build the database schema

A schema_migrations table is created which keeps track of migrations. This 
can be used to prevent duplicate migrations and to roll back previous
migrations. 

The seed command in Rake runs our seeds.rb file, which populates our database 
tables

The rake console command opens up irb with our environment loaded and enables 
us to interact with the models and databases. Active Record methods improve 
this interaction and enable lots of actions to see / modify the database.
